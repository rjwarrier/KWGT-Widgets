\## 🌅 Day Remain Widget



\*\*Day Remain\*\* is a minimalist \*\*KWGT time-awareness widget\*\* that dynamically displays \*\*time remaining or elapsed\*\* based on the current part of the day.



Depending on the time and solar conditions, the widget automatically shows:



\- Time remaining until \*\*sunrise\*\*

\- Time remaining until \*\*sunset\*\*

\- Time remaining until \*\*midnight\*\*

\- Time elapsed \*\*since midnight\*\*



The displayed value changes in real time, adapting to day–night transitions and solar events. Instead of counting down to a fixed date, the widget provides contextual information about \*\*where you are within the current day\*\*.



A custom dot-matrix style font is used to ensure high contrast, digital-style readability while keeping the design clean and distraction-free.



\*\*Best suited for:\*\*

\- At-a-glance understanding of the day’s progression  

\- Sunrise / sunset–aware home screen setups  

\- Minimalist KWGT widgets with dynamic logic
