**Day Remain** is a minimalist **KWGT time-awareness widget** that dynamically displays **time remaining or elapsed** based on the current part of the day.



Depending on the time and solar conditions, the widget automatically shows:



- Time remaining/lapsed until **sunrise** during night

- Time remaining/lapsed until **sunset** during day

- Time remaining/lapsed until **midnight**



The displayed value changes in real time, adapting to day–night transitions and solar events. Instead of counting down to a fixed date, the widget provides contextual information about **where you are within the current day**.



A custom dot-matrix style font is used to ensure high contrast, digital-style readability while keeping the design clean and distraction-free.



**Best suited for:**

- At-a-glance understanding of the day’s progression  

- Sunrise / sunset–aware home screen setups  

- Minimalist KWGT widgets with dynamic logic
