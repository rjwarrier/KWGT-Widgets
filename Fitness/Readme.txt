14 Days Fitness Widget - Reworked
Initial Release : 31-05-24 [Friday]

Update - 12 Oct
1. Steps data may be wrong because KWGT fetches data based on GMT and if your timezone is different, data fetched will not match with HC or Google Fit data. Also these widgets are not working for and am yet to find out a reaosn why these stopped working. I will these later.

2. In the meantime, i am uploading a new widget which will fetch data correctly for those in GMT+5.30 Timezone. Other, please adjust the formulas according to your timezone. You can edit in Globals.
